– WHAT: Initialized Logbook structure (plan.md, progress.md) and drafted initial prioritized plan.  
– DETAILS: Added eight tasks with ETA and dependencies to plan.md.  
– RESOURCES: zero-to-one.md spec  
– 2025-05-26 00:10  
– WHAT: Created repository skeleton directories (python/, node/, go/, docs/) and root README, language README placeholders, .gitignore.  
– DETAILS: Established scaffold structure for future SDK implementations.  
– RESOURCES: README.md, python/README.md, node/README.md, go/README.md, docs/README.md  
– 2025-05-26 00:20  
– WHAT: Initialized Python SDK with Poetry (`pyproject.toml`), basic directory structure (`aep_otel/`, `tests/`), a dummy test (`tests/test_main.py`), and a GitHub Actions CI workflow (`.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`) for linting (Ruff) and testing (Pytest) across Python 3.9-3.12.  
– DETAILS: `pyproject.toml` includes `opentelemetry` and `openai` as dependencies. CI workflow validates pushes/PRs to `main` targeting Python-related paths.  
– RESOURCES: `python/pyproject.toml`, `python/aep_otel/__init__.py`, `python/tests/test_main.py`, `.github/workflows/python-ci.yml`, `python/README.md`  
– 2025-05-26 00:35  
– WHAT: Implemented minimal Python OpenAI wrapper. Created `aep_otel.tracing` for OTEL setup (console export) and `aep_otel.hooks` for `openai.ChatCompletion.create` patching. Added an example script `examples/python/minimal_openai.py`, an `examples/env.example` for API keys, and tests for the patching mechanism in `python/tests/test_hooks.py`.  
– DETAILS: Patching injects spans with basic AEP attributes (`aep.stage_id`, placeholder `aep.llm.cost_usd`) and OTEL LLM semantic attributes. Exposed `patch_openai`, `unpatch_openai` through `aep_otel/__init__.py`. Added `python-dotenv` for example script.  
– RESOURCES: `python/aep_otel/tracing.py`, `python/aep_otel/hooks.py`, `python/aep_otel/__init__.py`, `examples/python/minimal_openai.py`, `examples/env.example`, `python/tests/test_hooks.py`, `python/pyproject.toml`, `python/README.md`  
– 2025-05-26 00:50  
– WHAT: Authored OpenTelemetry Collector sample configuration (`otel-collector-config.yaml`) and Docker Compose setup (`docker-compose.yml`) in `examples/collector/` for local trace collection with Jaeger. Updated Python SDK's `tracing.py` to conditionally use OTLP HTTP exporter if `OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set. Added `examples/collector/README.md` explaining the setup.  
– DETAILS: Collector configured for OTLP (HTTP/gRPC) receivers, logging exporter, and Jaeger exporter. Docker Compose includes `otel/opentelemetry-collector-contrib` and `jaegertracing/all-in-one`. Python SDK now supports both console and OTLP export simultaneously if configured.  
– RESOURCES: `examples/collector/otel-collector-config.yaml`, `examples/collector/docker-compose.yml`, `examples/collector/README.md`, `python/aep_otel/tracing.py`  
– 2025-05-26 01:05  
– WHAT: Drafted comprehensive root `README.md`.  
– DETAILS: Updated Quick-Start to include local collector and Jaeger setup. Embedded architecture diagram (Mermaid) from `zero-to-one.md`. Added detailed repository structure and updated project status/milestones table to reflect P-1 completion.  
– RESOURCES: `README.md`  
– 2025-05-26 01:20  
– WHAT: Configured `release-please` and GitHub Actions for automated Python SDK releases to PyPI.  
– DETAILS: Created `release-please-config.json` for the Python package. Added `.github/workflows/release-please.yml` to manage version bumps and changelogs via PRs. Added `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml` to publish to PyPI on new `aep-otel@v*` tags (using trusted publishing). Created initial `python/CHANGELOG.md`.  
– RESOURCES: `release-please-config.json`, `.github/workflows/release-please.yml`, `.github/workflows/pypi-publish.yml`, `python/CHANGELOG.md`  
– 2025-05-26 01:30  
– WHAT: Prepared for demo trace screenshot by creating `docs/assets/images/` and adding a placeholder with instructions to the root `README.md`.  
– DETAILS: User will need to run the Python example with the local collector, capture a screenshot of the trace in Jaeger, name it `jaeger_trace_python_openai_example.png`, place it in `docs/assets/images/`, and update the README.  
– RESOURCES: `README.md`, `docs/assets/images/.gitkeep`  
– 2025-05-26 03:15  
– WHAT: Successfully troubleshooted and confirmed end-to-end local trace pipeline for Python SDK. User provided Jaeger screenshot, which was embedded into `README.md`.  
– DETAILS: Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` by clarifying `poetry install` usage. Resolved OTLP exporter `ConnectionRefusedError` by fixing OTEL Collector config (`jaeger` exporter type changed to `otlp` targeting `jaeger:4317`). Resolved OTLP exporter `404` by explicitly setting `/v1/traces` path in Python exporter. End-to-end flow: Python script -> OTEL Collector -> Jaeger is now working.  
– RESOURCES: `README.md`, `docs/assets/images/jaeger_trace_python_openai_example.png` (user provided/added), `examples/collector/otel-collector-config.yaml`, `python/aep_otel/tracing.py`, `examples/python/minimal_openai.py`
